# ENGINEERING GUIDE

This document is the operational reference for changing MAMEKIT. Read
[SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) first when changing compiler or runtime
boundaries.

## 1. ENVIRONMENT

### REQUIRED

- Node.js 23.6 or newer;
- npm dependencies installed with `npm ci`;
- this repository at any path;
- a MAME checkout, normally at sibling path `../mame`;
- local ROMs only for acceptance and manual browser validation.

MAME source discovery order is implemented by the CLI. Override automatic
discovery with:

```sh
node bin/mamekit.js <target> --mame-src /path/to/mame
```

or set `MAME_SRC`.

Node runs repository TypeScript directly. The browser distribution is compiled
with the local TypeScript dependency using `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`.

## 2. COMMANDS

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run clean` | remove all generated distribution output |
| `npm run gen -- <target>` | extract and generate one target, then build app |
| `npm run gen:all` | clean and generate the branch's currently selected targets |
| `npm run build` | type-check repository TypeScript without writing to `dist` |
| `npm run test:unit` | strict type check plus every source/compiler/runtime spec |
| `npm run test:current` | clean-generate and audit the current four games |
| `npm run audit:generated` | audit the games currently present in `dist` |
| `npm run test:generation` | clean-generate every required target and audit all output |
| `npm run test:games` | deterministic real-ROM contracts for supported games |
| `npm run test:games:record` | print candidate game baselines for review |
| `npm run serve` | rebuild app shell and serve `dist` on localhost |
| `npm run deploy -- --artwork` | clean-generate and publish the static site |

The broad `test:generation` command is destructive to `dist` and expensive. It
generates all targets in `src/gen/targets.ts`, not only the targets listed in
`gen:all`.

## 3. CLEAN GENERATION IS MANDATORY

Never evaluate a complete build on top of an existing `dist`. Deleted or
renamed generated modules can survive and hide missing compiler behavior.

The accepted full sequence is:

```sh
npm run clean
npm run gen:all
npm run audit:generated
```

`gen:all` already invokes `clean`; the explicit form is useful when running
individual CLI phases manually.

The app build also recreates `dist/app`, `dist/runtime/core`, and its temporary
`dist/.build` staging tree. It does not delete canonical per-game or generated
hardware data because those are emitted by earlier phases.

## 4. GENERATING ONE TARGET

Use this sequence while bringing up a target in isolation:

```sh
npm run clean
node bin/mamekit.js <target> --skip-app
node bin/mamekit.js --build-runtime --build-app --targets <target>
npm run audit:generated
```

`--targets` accepts registered targets from `src/gen/targets.ts`. Add a new
target there before building its shared hardware closure.

The target is categorized from its MAME declaration:

```
dist/games/arcade/<target>/
dist/games/consoles/<target>/
```

Inspect these files before opening the browser:

- `graph.json`: target dependency graph;
- `graph.full.json`: full driver context;
- `config.json`: browser/ROM/input facts;
- `generated/machine.json`: complete executable machine IR;
- `generated/provenance.json`: source ownership;
- `runtime-report.md`: generated behavior and hardware gaps;
- `DOSSIER.md`: generated archival machine document.

## 5. ADDING A TARGET

### STEP 1: REGISTER AND EXTRACT

Add the MAME short name to `src/gen/targets.ts` when it should participate in
the all-target generation contract. Then run:

```sh
node bin/mamekit.js graph <target>
```

Review the CLI's device and ROM-region digest. Open the generated graph viewer
or inspect graph JSON. Confirm:

- the intended `Game` node exists;
- the category is correct;
- machine configuration call chains are complete;
- every CPU and device has the expected tag and clock;
- each CPU has the correct program and I/O maps;
- ROM regions, offsets, sizes and hashes match MAME;
- input polarity and DIP defaults are present;
- graphics layouts and decode entries are reachable;
- callbacks and screen-update handlers have source locations.

Do not begin browser debugging while the graph is visibly incomplete.

### STEP 2: GENERATE MACHINE IR

Run target generation with `--skip-app`. Inspect `runtime-report.json` and the
generated machine. Compiler diagnostics identify unsupported source forms more
reliably than a blank browser screen.

The generated board module should remain a small import/composition wrapper.
If it contains game logic or large literals, that logic is being emitted at the
wrong layer.

### STEP 3: BUILD THE HARDWARE CLOSURE

Build runtime/app for only the target. Check
`dist/runtime/generated/hardware-report.md` and
`hardware-manifest.json`.

Each required non-host hardware type must be executable. A type may be:

- generated CPU;
- generated device;
- generated audio implementation;
- generated machine composition;
- explicitly declarative browser-host service.

Do not mark unsupported hardware as executable to make the catalog button
appear. The runtime report and manifest are honesty contracts.

### STEP 4: ADD ACCEPTANCE COVERAGE

Add focused compiler specs for every new AST or lowering rule. Add the small
game token and colocated source spec described in [TESTING](TESTING.md), then
record a real-ROM contract when target behavior reaches boot/video/input/audio.

Acceptance tests import compiled modules from `dist`. They should not import a
source-side emulation implementation because that bypasses the artifact being
validated.

### STEP 5: EXPAND `gen:all`

Only add the target to `package.json`'s `gen:all` target list after its clean
generation and browser acceptance pass. This keeps branch-wide iteration
focused while preserving the broader required-target test separately.

## 6. WHERE TO FIX A FAILURE

Choose the layer from evidence, not from the visible symptom.

| Evidence | Correct owner |
|---|---|
| Target or macro facts missing from graph | `src/kg/parse.ts` or `src/kg/build.ts` |
| Method/class/source span missing | `src/mame/ast.ts` or source discovery |
| Wrong graph relationship or closure | KG edge construction/subgraph logic |
| Handler has unsupported syntax | `src/mame/handler-ir.ts` |
| CPU opcode expansion/semantics missing | opcode DSL or CPU compiler/codegen |
| Device method cannot lower | device compiler or generic handler vocabulary |
| Palette/tile/sprite/bitmap plan incomplete | video compiler and generated video IR |
| Audio control/topology/component plan incomplete | audio compiler and generated worklet |
| IR is correct but execution is wrong for every target | generic runtime |
| Only one game needs a hardcoded branch | source/graph/IR model is still missing a fact |
| App cannot locate config/module | output layout, manifest `dataPath`, or relative URL |
| Old deleted code appears to work | stale `dist`; clean and reproduce |

The default solution is a reusable MAME-source lowering improvement. Never add
`src/runtime/z80.ts`, `src/runtime/ay8910.ts`, a game-named renderer, or a
family board adapter.

## 7. TEST STRATEGY

The complete QA architecture, supported-game token pattern, CI boundary,
golden policy and failure triage are defined in [TESTING](TESTING.md).

### GENERATED AUDIT

```sh
npm run audit:generated
```

The audit scans every target currently present under both game categories. It
checks:

- required config, graph, machine, board and provenance files;
- machine schema, CPU plan, callbacks and screen timing;
- source handler lowering diagnostics;
- hardware closure artifacts;
- canonical app registry imports;
- no handwritten MAME hardware files under `src/runtime`;
- no legacy `dist/app/modules` duplication;
- no temporary `.build` tree;
- no embedded serialized IR in generated JavaScript;
- no imports of `src` or absolute local paths.

### ALL-TARGET GENERATION

```sh
npm run test:generation
```

This is the highest-confidence compiler contract. It deletes `dist`, generates
every required arcade game and console, builds one hardware closure and app,
runs the generated audit, and verifies that the generated catalog has no
blocked target.

Run it after changes to shared parsing, graph reachability, IR schemas,
hardware closure resolution, build topology, or app registration.

### BROWSER VERIFICATION

For UI/runtime changes, test the final generated distribution with Playwright
or a real browser. Required checks:

1. menu loads both categories from `games.json`;
2. target route imports its canonical generated board;
3. JSON module imports receive `application/json` MIME;
4. local ROM file picker accepts and validates the correct set;
5. framebuffer is nonblank and correctly oriented;
6. status PC values progress and frame rate is stable;
7. coin, start and gameplay inputs are observed;
8. generated audio worklet loads after a user gesture;
9. page and console error logs remain empty;
10. desktop/mobile layout has no overlap.

Use screenshots and canvas-pixel checks for visual changes. A successful HTTP
response alone does not validate an emulator frame.

## 8. OUTPUT INSPECTION

Useful checks after generation:

```sh
find dist -maxdepth 5 -type f | sort
du -sh dist/app dist/runtime dist/games
rg -n "app/modules|/src/|JSON\.parse\(\"\{" dist
git diff --check
```

Expected properties:

- `dist/app` is small and contains no runtime/game copies;
- shared generated hardware appears once under `dist/runtime/generated`;
- each target appears once under its category;
- generated board source is small;
- large machine/hardware values are JSON;
- compiled output uses only relative imports within `dist`.

## 9. TYPESCRIPT AND SOURCE CONVENTIONS

Repository TypeScript uses strict mode and `erasableSyntaxOnly` because Node
runs CLI files through native type stripping.

- avoid enums, namespaces and constructor parameter properties;
- use `import type` for type-only imports;
- use `.ts` extensions in source imports where repository conventions require
  them;
- generated browser builds rewrite relative TypeScript imports to `.js`;
- use structured parsers/IR rather than source-string replacement;
- preserve source spans through each lowering stage;
- fail with diagnostics instead of adding permissive behavior.

Keep checked-in comments focused on non-obvious source assumptions or lowering
semantics.

## 10. DOCUMENTATION RULES

The current documentation set is intentionally minimal:

- root `README.md`;
- `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`;
- `docs/ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md`;
- `docs/TESTING.md`;
- `sessions/ARCHIVE_INDEX.md` for historical evidence.

Documentation filenames use `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md`, except the
repository-standard root `README.md` and tool-standard `CLAUDE.md`.

Do not add another README or a narrow document that duplicates an existing
section. Extend one of the three engineering references. Generated per-machine
archival text is named `DOSSIER.md`.

Raw session transcripts are historical. Current code and current engineering
documents always take precedence.

## 11. DEPLOYMENT

Production is a static GitHub Pages site at `mamehistory.com`.

```sh
npm run deploy -- --artwork
```

The deployment script:

1. runs clean `gen:all`;
2. optionally copies deployable artwork while excluding development history
   data;
3. updates generated artwork flags;
4. writes `.nojekyll` and the configured `CNAME`;
5. creates an ephemeral Git repository inside `dist`;
6. force-pushes one static snapshot to `gh-pages`;
7. removes the ephemeral repository.

ROMs are never deployed. Deployment requires the local MAME checkout and any
opt-in local artwork/history assets, so it is manual by design.

All runtime paths must remain relative. Pretty routes are real
`app/g/<target>/index.html` files with `<base href="../../">`. Production audio
requires HTTPS because AudioWorklet requires a secure context.

## 12. CHANGE COMPLETION CHECKLIST

Before considering compiler/runtime work complete:

1. clean generation succeeds;
2. unit and focused compiler tests pass;
3. generated audit passes;
4. relevant real-ROM acceptance passes;
5. browser frame/input/audio verification passes when behavior is user-facing;
6. generated output contains no duplicate or stale tree;
7. runtime reports expose no hidden new gap;
8. documentation still describes the actual output and ownership boundary;
9. `git diff --check` is clean;
10. unrelated user changes remain untouched.
