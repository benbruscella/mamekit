// Black for all 1200 frames. Like simpsons, the Konami video chips are
// runtime bridges rather than generated devices: K052109, K051960, K007232
// and UPD7759 are all still generation gaps.
//
// Move this module and its spec back up to src/games/ to re-enable the
// target once the fault is fixed.
