// Marble Madness (Atari Games, 1984). Atari System 1: 68010 + 6502, slapstic
// 103, a trackball rotated 45 degrees.
//
// Every fault between "boots" and "plays" was a general one, verified against
// real MAME 0.289 rather than recorded over:
//
// 1. The watchdog hang at frame ~346. MAME's 68010 is still the Musashi core,
//    whose immediate reads prefetch the next word; the slapstic counts those
//    reads, and without them its bank state drifted off MAME's.
// 2. Latch handshakes. generic_latch_8 writes synchronize: the writer's slice
//    ends and the sound CPU catches up before the store. Main RAM is now 1
//    byte from MAME at frame 900.
// 3. The black screen: graphics sets built at run time (make_unique
//    <gfx_element>, set_gfx, MAX_GFX_ELEMENTS lost to an include-guard parse
//    bug), tilemap RAM writes that never marked tiles dirty, 16-bit shares read
//    byte-swapped, a Gauntlet screen executor claiming this board, and MAME
//    rectangle accessors. Frame 899 is pixel-identical to MAME's frame 900.
// 4. Dead controls: the video compiler took the driver file's first GAME
//    (Peter Pack Rat, init_peterpak: a joystick) instead of init_marble.
//
// Attract mode is black until about frame 400 in MAME too.
