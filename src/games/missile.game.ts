// Issue #151. Missile Command routes every CPU access through an
// address_map_bank_device, re-samples its IRQ on the 6502's SYNC line, halves
// the CPU clock for the lines video fetches steal, and arms its scanline IRQ
// with its own emu_timers. Verified against MAME 0.289 in attract with no
// input: frame 60 is 0 differing pixels; the instruction trace matches MAME's
// for the first ten frames but for interrupt phase. The attract animation
// diverges from about frame 120, because POKEY's RANDOM register is stepped per
// read here rather than per chip clock. The default DIPs ask for two coins.
